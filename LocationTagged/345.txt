This
thing
with
central
and
northern
Florida   B-Location
is   I-Location
that
they
are
build
around
hurricane
codes
and
they
can
withstand
hurricane
force
winds
unlike
us
in
the
keys.
Weâ€™re
built
on
islands
therefore
the
slightest
winds
can
potentially
flatten
us
out...
Always
be
prepared
and
stay
safe.
